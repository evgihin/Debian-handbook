msgid "Conclusion: Debian's Future"
msgstr "Konklusion: Debians fremtid"

msgid "The story of Falcot Corp ends with this last chapter; but Debian lives on, and the future will certainly bring many interesting surprises."
msgstr "Historien om Falcot-selskabet slutter i dette sidste kapitel; men Debian lever videre, og fremtiden vil helt klart give mange interessante overraskelser."

msgid "Upcoming Developments"
msgstr "Kommende udviklinger"

msgid "Now that Debian version 10 is out, the developers are already busy working on the next version, codenamed <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Bullseye</emphasis>…"
msgstr "Nu Debian version 10 er ude, er udviklerne allerede travelt optaget af at arbejde på næste version, med kodenavn <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Bullseye</emphasis>…"

msgid "There is no official list of planned changes, and Debian never makes promises relating to technical goals of the coming versions. However, a few development trends can already be noted, and we can try to guess what might happen (or not)."
msgstr ""

msgid "In order to improve security and trust, an increasing number of packages will be made to build reproducibly; that is to say, it will be possible to rebuild byte-for-byte identical binary packages from the source packages, thus allowing everyone to verify that no tampering has happened during the builds. This feature might even be required by the release managers for testing migration."
msgstr ""

msgid "In a related theme, a lot of effort will have gone into improving security by default, with more packages shipping an AppArmor profile."
msgstr ""

msgid "Of course, all the main software suites will have had a major release. The latest version of the various desktops will bring better usability and new features. Wayland, the new display server, will likely obsolete X11 entirely."
msgstr ""

msgid "With the widespread use of continuous integration and the growth of the archive (and of the biggest packages!), the constraints on release architectures will be harder to meet and some architectures will be dropped (like <emphasis>mips</emphasis>, <emphasis>mipsel</emphasis> and maybe <emphasis>mips64el</emphasis>)."

msgid "Debian's Future"
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition to these internal developments, one can reasonably expect new Debian-based distributions to come to light, as many tools keep simplifying this task. New specialized subprojects will also be started, in order to widen Debian's reach to new horizons."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Debian user community will increase, and new contributors will join the project… including, maybe, you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "There are recurring discussions about how the software ecosystem is evolving, towards applications shipped within containers, where Debian packages have no added value, or with language-specific package managers (e.g. <command>pip</command> for Python, <command>npm</command> for JavaScript, etc.), which are rendering <command>dpkg</command> and <command>apt</command> obsolete. Facing those threats, I am convinced that Debian developers will find ways to embrace those evolutions and to continue to provide value to users."
msgstr ""

msgid "In spite of its old age and its respectable size, Debian keeps on growing in all kinds of (sometimes unexpected) directions. Contributors are teeming with ideas, and discussions on development mailing lists, even when they look like bickerings, keep increasing the momentum. Debian is sometimes compared to a black hole, of such density that any new free software project is attracted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Beyond the apparent satisfaction of most Debian users, a deep trend is becoming more and more indisputable: people are increasingly realizing that collaborating, rather than working alone in their corner, leads to better results for everyone. Such is the rationale used by distributions merging into Debian by way of subprojects."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Debian project is therefore not threatened by extinction…"

msgid "Future of this Book"
msgstr ""

msgid "We would like this book to evolve in the spirit of free software. We therefore welcome contributions, remarks, suggestions, and criticism. Please direct them to Raphaël (<email>hertzog@debian.org</email>) or Roland (<email>lolando@debian.org</email>). For actionable feedback, feel free to open bug reports against the <literal>debian-handbook</literal> Debian package. The website will be used to gather all information relevant to its evolution, and you will find there information on how to contribute, in particular if you want to translate this book to make it available to an even larger public than today. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://debian-handbook.info/\" />"
msgstr ""

msgid "We tried to integrate most of what our experience with Debian taught us, so that anyone can use this distribution and take the best advantage of it as soon as possible. We hope this book contributes to making Debian less confusing and more popular, and we welcome publicity around it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "We would like to conclude on a personal note. Writing (and translating) this book took a considerable amount of time out of our usual professional activity. Since we are both freelance consultants, any new source of income grants us the freedom to spend more time improving Debian; we hope this book to be successful and to contribute to this. In the meantime, feel free to retain our services! <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://www.freexian.com\" /> <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.gnurandal.com\" />"
