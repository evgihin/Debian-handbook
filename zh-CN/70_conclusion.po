This improves compatibility between all Unix systems, makes us closer of having all Debian-supplied files in a single top-level directory that can be easily protected, snapshotted or shared. You can learn more about the benefits here: <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/TheCaseForTheUsrMerge/\" />"

msgid "In spite of its old age and its respectable size, Debian keeps on growing in all kinds of (sometimes unexpected) directions. Contributors are teeming with ideas, and discussions on development mailing lists, even when they look like bickerings, keep increasing the momentum. Debian is sometimes compared to a black hole, of such density that any new free software project is attracted."
msgstr "尽管 Debian 发展了很多年，规模也已可观，但是 Debian 依然在向各种方向发展（有时候也会向你意想不到的方向）。Debian 的贡献者们都很有想法，他们通过开发邮件列表来讨论，甚至他们看起来像是在吵架，但正是这些给 Debian 提供了持续的动力。Debian 有时候可以比作是一个黑洞，如此的有吸引力，以至于任何新的自由软件项目都可以吸纳进来。"
