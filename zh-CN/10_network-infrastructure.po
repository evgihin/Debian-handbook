msgid "A gateway is a system linking several networks. This term often refers to a local network's “exit point” on the mandatory path to all external IP addresses. The gateway is connected to each of the networks it links together, and acts as a router to convey IP packets between its various interfaces."
msgstr "“网关”用于连接多个网络。这个词常常用于表示本地网络通往外部 IP 地址的“出口”。网关充当路由器的身份，在它的多个网络接口间转发 IP 包，从而把它所连接的不同网络联系起来。"

msgid "Most networks nowadays use the IP protocol (<emphasis>Internet Protocol</emphasis>). This protocol segments the transmitted data into limited-size packets. Each packet contains, in addition to its payload data, a number of details required for its proper routing."
msgstr "今天，大部分的网络使用 IP 通信协议 (<emphasis>Internet Protocol</emphasis>)。这种协议把传输数据切割成小小的封包。除了实际传输的数据外，每个封包还包括必备的路由信息。"

msgid "Many programs do not handle the individual packets themselves, even though the data they transmit does travel over IP; they often use TCP (<emphasis>Transmission Control Protocol</emphasis>). TCP is a layer over IP allowing the establishment of connections dedicated to data streams between two points. The programs then only see an entry point into which data can be fed with the guarantee that the same data exits without loss (and in the same sequence) at the exit point at the other end of the connection. Although many kinds of errors can happen in the lower layers, they are compensated by TCP: lost packets are retransmitted, and packets arriving out of order (for example, if they used different paths) are re-ordered appropriately."
msgstr "即使在 IP 上传输数据，大部分程序都不处理个别的封包问题；他们通常使用 TCP (<emphasis>Transmission Control Protocol</emphasis>)。TCP 是 IP 的上层，为专属的数据流创建两点间的链接。程序只看到数据进来的条目，并保证同样的数据无误 (且以同样顺序) 流到另端链接的出口。在较低层可能发生多种错误，都可以被 TCP 补偿：重送失去的封包、重组到达的封包 (例如，经由不同路径送到) 的顺序。"

msgid "Another protocol relying on IP is UDP (<emphasis>User Datagram Protocol</emphasis>). In contrast to TCP, it is packet-oriented. Its goals are different: the purpose of UDP is only to transmit one packet from an application to another. The protocol does not try to compensate for possible packet loss on the way, nor does it ensure that packets are received in the same order as were sent. The main advantage to this protocol is that the latency is greatly improved, since the loss of a single packet does not delay the receiving of all following packets until the lost one is retransmitted."
msgstr "另个在 IP 上的协议是 UDP (<emphasis>User Datagram Protocol</emphasis>)。与 TCP 不同，它是封包导向的。它的目标不同：UDP 的目的是在应用程序间传输封包。此协议不补偿封包的遗漏，也不在意封包依序到达。此协议的主要优点是，大幅改善延迟的问题，遗漏的封包不影响接收后续封包，并且持续重送该遗漏的封包。"

msgid "TCP and UDP both involve ports, which are “extension numbers” for establishing communication with a given application on a machine. This concept allows keeping several different communications in parallel with the same correspondent, since these communications can be distinguished by the port number."
msgstr "TCP 和 UDP 都涉及封包，也就是以 \"分机号码\" 模式在机器内的程序创建链接。此做法允许在同个通信中创建多个平行的管道，因为它们以不同的端口号区分之。"

msgid "Some of these port numbers — standardized by the IANA (<emphasis>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</emphasis>) — are “well-known” for being associated with network services. For instance, TCP port 25 is generally used by the email server. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml\" />"
msgstr "部分端口号 — 由 IANA (<emphasis>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</emphasis>) 规范 — 以与网络服务相关而 “知名”。例如，TCP 端口号 25 系供电子邮件服务器使用。<ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml\" />"

msgid "When a local network uses a private address range (not routable on the Internet), the gateway needs to implement <emphasis>address masquerading</emphasis> so that the machines on the network can communicate with the outside world. The masquerading operation is a kind of proxy operating on the network level: each outgoing connection from an internal machine is replaced with a connection from the gateway itself (since the gateway does have an external, routable address), the data going through the masqueraded connection is sent to the new one, and the data coming back in reply is sent through to the masqueraded connection to the internal machine. The gateway uses a range of dedicated TCP ports for this purpose, usually with very high numbers (over 60000). Each connection coming from an internal machine then appears to the outside world as a connection coming from one of these reserved ports."
msgstr "局域网路接在私人网址范围内 (不在网络网络的路由上)，网关就需要 <emphasis>地址掩蔽</emphasis> 让其经由网络与外界沟通。掩蔽作业是网络层次的代理工作：内部机器，都被网关取代 (因为网关有外部的路由地址)，借由掩蔽链接，数据送出出去，进来的数据经由掩蔽链接至内部机器。网关以指定的 TCP 端口运行此工作，通常是较高的号码 (超过 60000)。对外部而言，经由内部机器的链接，就是来自此等保留端口号。"

msgid "The gateway can also perform two kinds of <emphasis>network address translation</emphasis> (or NAT for short). The first kind, <emphasis>Destination NAT</emphasis> (DNAT) is a technique to alter the destination IP address (and/or the TCP or UDP port) for a (generally) incoming connection. The connection tracking mechanism also alters the following packets in the same connection to ensure continuity in the communication. The second kind of NAT is <emphasis>Source NAT</emphasis> (SNAT), of which <emphasis>masquerading</emphasis> is a particular case; SNAT alters the source IP address (and/or the TCP or UDP port) of a (generally) outgoing connection. As for DNAT, all the packets in the connection are appropriately handled by the connection tracking mechanism. Note that NAT is only relevant for IPv4 and its limited address space; in IPv6, the wide availability of addresses greatly reduces the usefulness of NAT by allowing all “internal” addresses to be directly routable on the Internet (this does not imply that internal machines are accessible, since intermediary firewalls can filter traffic)."
msgstr "网关有两种 <emphasis>网络地址转换</emphasis> (英文缩写 NAT) 的功能。第一种是 <emphasis>目的 NAT</emphasis> (DNAT)，改变封包目的 IP 地址 (与 TCP 或 UDP 端口)。链接追踪机制同时改变后续封包的链接。第二种 NAT 是 <emphasis>来源 NAT</emphasis> (SNAT)，其中的 <emphasis>伪装</emphasis> 是特例之一；SNAT 改变出去链接的来源 IP 地址 (与 TCP 或 UDP 端口)。如同 DNAT，所有的封包由链接追踪机制处理。NAT 只用于 IPv4 及其限制的地址空间；在 IPv6 内，其宽广的地址技术允许直接在互联网路由 (并不表示可以近用内部机器，因为防火墙可以过滤流量) 减少 NAT 的用途。"

However, explicitly writing the parameters for all hosts in a non-trivial set of machines quickly becomes an arduous task, since the number of tunnels grows fast. Installing an IKE daemon (for <emphasis>IPsec Key Exchange</emphasis>) such as <emphasis role=\"pkg\">racoon</emphasis> or <emphasis role=\"pkg\">strongswan</emphasis> makes the process much simpler by bringing administration together at a central point, and more secure by rotating the keys periodically."
#~ msgstr "仅管 IPsec 已是 IP VPN 的标准，不过在应用层面仍有待加强。IPsec 引擎本身已经集成入 Linux 核心；控制与配置工具等必备的用户部分，已由 <emphasis role=\"pkg\">ipsec-tools</emphasis> 软件包提供。具体来说，每个主机的 <filename>/etc/ipsec-tools.conf</filename> 包括给 <emphasis>IPsec tunnels</emphasis> (或 <emphasis>Security Associations</emphasis>，以 IPsec 术语来说) 使用的参数，让主机连进来；<command>/etc/init.d/setkey</command> 脚本提供启用与停止信道的方法 (每个信道是安全链接至另个主机虚拟私有网络)。可以参考 <citerefentry><refentrytitle>setkey</refentrytitle> <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> 手册提供的文档，以人工方式创建此文件。然而，撰写供所有主机使用的参数，并不轻松反而极为烦琐，因为信道的数量急剧增加。安装 IKE 调度 (如 <emphasis>IPsec Key Exchange</emphasis>) 就像 <emphasis role=\"pkg\">racoon</emphasis> 或 <emphasis role=\"pkg\">strongswan</emphasis> 把管理带入中央的点，就可简化此进程，而且定期更换密钥，显得更安全。"
