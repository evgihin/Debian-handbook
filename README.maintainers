Some notes for the the project maintainers
==========================================

The information here is only interesting for the project maintainers.

How to merge from weblate
-------------------------

1. Go to https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/debian-handbook/#repository
   and "lock" the repository. This will ensure nobody can make further
   changes and will commit uncommitted changes.

2. In your local checkout, fetch the weblate remote repository:
   $ git fetch weblate
   If you don't have it configured, do it:
   $ git remote add weblate https://hosted.weblate.org/git/debian-handbook/12_advanced-administration

3. Checkout the buster/master branch from weblate in "weblate-merge":
   $ git checkout -B weblate-merge weblate/buster/master

4. Rebase it on top on buster/master and squash as many commits as
   possible. You can get a list of commands to feed by executing
   bin/merge-weblate
   $ bin/merge-weblate >/tmp/rebase-commands
   $ git rebase -i buster/master  # feed content of /tmp/rebase-commands
                                  # instead of list provided by git

5. Switch back to buster/master and merge weblate-merge.
   $ git checkout buster/master
   $ git merge weblate-merge

6. Run "bin/build-all". If some languages fail to build, find out why
   and fix it. Usually it's due to some XML markup mistakes. Commit
   those fixes with "git commit -a -m '<language-code>: fix XML markup'"
   or something along those lines.

7. Update the POT/PO files if some changes have been committed to the
   English text.
   $ bin/update-l10n

8. Push the changes to the git repository on salsa.debian.org:
   $ git push

9. Force reset changes in the weblate git repository. You do this
   from https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/debian-handbook/#repository
   with the "Reset" button.

10. Unlock the changes in weblate. From the same page click the "Unlock"
    button.
