As with any community, it has rules that need to be followed. Before asking any question, you should check that your problem isn't already covered by recent discussions on the list or by any official documentation. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMailingLists\" /> <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/\" /> <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://lists.debian.org/users.html\" />"

In this case, the proper procedure is to report the bug to Debian or directly to the upstream developers. To do this, isolate the problem as much as possible and create a minimal test situation in which it can be reproduced. If you know which program is the apparent cause of the problem, you can find its corresponding package using the command, <command>dpkg -S <replaceable>file_in_question</replaceable></command>. Check the Bug Tracking System (<literal>https://bugs.debian.org/<replaceable>package</replaceable></literal>) to ensure that the bug has not already been reported. You can then send your own bug report, using the <command>reportbug</command> command, including as much information as possible, especially a complete description of those minimal test cases that will allow anyone to recreate the bug."
