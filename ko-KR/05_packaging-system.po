Thus, any package that needs this service to be functional (e.g. a mailing list manager, such as <emphasis role=\"pkg\">smartlist</emphasis> or <emphasis role=\"pkg\">sympa</emphasis>) simply states in its dependencies that it requires a <emphasis role=\"pkg\">mail-transport-agent</emphasis> instead of specifying a large yet incomplete list of possible solutions (e.g. <command>postfix | sendmail | exim4 | …</command>). Furthermore, it is useless to install two mail servers on the same machine, which is why each of these packages declares a conflict with the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">mail-transport-agent</emphasis> virtual package. A conflict between a package and itself is ignored by the system, but this technique will prohibit the installation of two mail servers side by side."

msgid "Quite frequently, a source package (for a given software) can generate several binary packages. The split is justified by the possibility to use (parts of) the software in different contexts. Consider a shared library, it may be installed to make an application work (for example, <emphasis role=\"pkg\">libc6</emphasis>), or it can be installed to develop a new program (<emphasis role=\"pkg\">libc6-dev</emphasis> will then be the correct package). We find the same logic for client/server services where we want to install the server part on one machine and the client part on others (this is the case, for example, of <emphasis role=\"pkg\">openssh-server</emphasis> and <emphasis role=\"pkg\">openssh-client</emphasis>)."
