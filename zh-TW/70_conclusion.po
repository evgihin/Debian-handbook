msgid "Beyond usual deprecation of some software components, it is worth pointing out that Debian is in the process of switching to what is known as a <emphasis>merged-usr filesystem</emphasis>: in this scheme <literal>/bin</literal>, <literal>/sbin</literal> and <literal>/lib</literal> are symlinks pointing to the corresponding directories in <literal>/usr</literal>. This improves compatibility between all Unix systems, makes us closer of having all Debian-supplied files in a single top-level directory that can be easily protected, snapshotted or shared. You can learn more about the benefits here: <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/TheCaseForTheUsrMerge/\" />"

The Debian technical committee's help has been requested multiple times already.

msgid "There are recurring discussions about how the software ecosystem is evolving, towards applications shipped within containers, where Debian packages have no added value, or with language-specific package managers (e.g. <command>pip</command> for Python, <command>npm</command> for JavaScript, etc.), which are rendering <command>dpkg</command> and <command>apt</command> obsolete. Facing those threats, I am convinced that Debian developers will find ways to embrace those changes and to continue to provide value to users."

msgid "In spite of its old age and its respectable size, Debian keeps on growing in all kinds of (sometimes unexpected) directions. Contributors are teeming with ideas, and discussions on development mailing lists, even when they look like bickerings, keep increasing the momentum. Debian is sometimes compared to a black hole, of such density that any new free software project is attracted."
msgstr "儘管 Debian 已經很老了，體型也相當可觀，但它仍然在向各種（有時是意想不到的）方向發展。投稿人充滿了想法，開發郵寄清單上的討論，即使它們看起來像爭吵，也在不斷增加勢頭。Debian 有時被比作黑洞，其密度足以吸引任何新的自由軟體項目。"
