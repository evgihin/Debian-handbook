msgid "Many Linux distributions are derivatives of Debian and reuse Debian's package management tools. They all have their own interesting properties, and it is possible one of them will fulfill your needs better than Debian itself."

msgid "The Debian project fully acknowledges the importance of derivative distributions and actively supports collaboration between all involved parties. This usually involves merging back the improvements initially developed by derivative distributions so that everyone can benefit and long-term maintenance work is reduced."
msgstr ""

msgid "This explains why derivative distributions are invited to become involved in discussions on the <literal>debian-derivatives@lists.debian.org</literal> mailing-list, and to participate in the derivative census. This census aims at collecting information on work happening in a derivative so that official Debian maintainers can better track the state of their package in Debian variants. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://wiki.debian.org/DerivativesFrontDesk\" /><ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census\" />"

msgid "<primary><emphasis role=\"distribution\">Ubuntu</emphasis></primary>"
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis role=\"distribution\">Ubuntu</emphasis> made quite a splash when it came on the free software scene, and for good reason: Canonical Ltd., the company that created this distribution, started by hiring thirty-odd Debian developers and publicly stating the far-reaching objective of providing a distribution for the general public with a new release twice a year. They also committed to maintaining each version for a year and a half."
msgstr ""

msgid "These objectives necessarily involve a reduction in scope; Ubuntu focuses on a smaller number of packages than Debian, and relies primarily on the GNOME desktop (although there are Ubuntu derivatives that come with other desktop environments). Everything is internationalized and made available in a great many languages."

msgid "<primary><emphasis role=\"distribution\">Kubuntu</emphasis></primary>"
msgstr ""

msgid "So far, Ubuntu has managed to keep this release rhythm. They also publish <emphasis>Long Term Support</emphasis> (LTS) releases, with a 5-year maintenance promise. As of April 2021, the current LTS version is version 20.04, nicknamed Bionic Beaver. The last non-LTS version is version 21.04, nicknamed Hirsute Hippo. Version numbers describe the release date: 21.04, for example, was released in April 2021."

Canonical, as a company, promises to provide security updates to all the software available in the <literal>main</literal> and <literal>restricted</literal> sections of the Ubuntu archive, for 5 years for LTS releases and for 9 months for non-LTS releases. Everything else (available in the <literal>universe</literal> and <literal>multiverse</literal>) is maintained on a best-effort basis by volunteers of the MOTU team (<emphasis>Masters Of The Universe</emphasis>). Be prepared to handle security support yourself if you rely on packages of the latter sections."

msgid "Ubuntu has reached a wide audience in the general public. Millions of users were impressed by its ease of installation, and the work that went into making the desktop simpler to use."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ubuntu and Debian used to have a tense relationship; Debian developers who had placed great hopes in Ubuntu contributing directly to Debian were disappointed by the difference between the Canonical marketing, which implied Ubuntu were good citizens in the Free Software world, and the actual practice where they simply made public the changes they applied to Debian packages. Things have been getting better over the years, and Ubuntu has now made it general practice to forward patches to the most appropriate place (although this only applies to external software they package and not to the Ubuntu-specific software such as Mir or Unity). <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/\" />"

msgid "<primary><emphasis role=\"distribution\">Linux Mint</emphasis></primary>"
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis role=\"distribution\">Linux Mint</emphasis> is a (partly) community-maintained distribution, supported by donations and advertisements. Their flagship product is based on Ubuntu, but they also provide a “Linux Mint Debian Edition” (LMDE), which is based on Debian Stable with a few backports. LMDE is available for both 32 and 64-bit."
msgstr ""

msgid "In both cases, the initial installation involves booting a live DVD or a live USB storage device."
msgstr ""

msgid "The distribution aims at simplifying access to advanced technologies, and provides specific graphical user interfaces on top of the usual software. For instance, Linux Mint relies on Cinnamon instead of GNOME by default (but it also includes MATE as well as Xfce); similarly, the package management interface, although based on APT, provides a specific interface with an evaluation of the risk from each package update."

msgid "The <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Knoppix</emphasis> distribution barely needs an introduction. It was the first popular distribution to provide a <emphasis>live CD</emphasis>; in other words, a bootable CD-ROM that runs a turn-key Linux system with no requirement for a hard-disk — any system already installed on the machine will be left untouched. Automatic detection of available devices allows this distribution to work in most hardware configurations. The CD-ROM includes almost 1 GB of (compressed) software, and the DVD-ROM version has around 4.5 GB."
msgstr ""

msgid "Combining this CD-ROM to a USB stick allows carrying your files with you, and to work on any computer without leaving a trace — remember that the distribution doesn't use the hard-disk at all. Knoppix uses LXDE (a lightweight graphical desktop) by default, but the DVD version also includes GNOME and Plasma. Many other distributions provide other combinations of desktops and software. This is, in part, made possible thanks to the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">live-build</emphasis> Debian package that makes it relatively easy to create a live CD. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/\" />"
