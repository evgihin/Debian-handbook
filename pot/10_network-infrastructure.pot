msgid "A gateway is a system linking several networks. This term often refers to a local network's “exit point” on the mandatory path to all external IP addresses.

msgid "Many programs do not handle the individual packets themselves, even though the data they transmit does travel over IP; they often use TCP (<emphasis>Transmission Control Protocol</emphasis>). TCP is a layer over IP allowing the establishment of connections dedicated to data streams between two points. The programs then only see an entry point into which data can be fed with the guarantee that the same data exits without loss (and in the same sequence) at the exit point at the other end of the connection. Although many kinds of errors can happen in the lower layers, they are compensated by TCP: lost packets are retransmitted, and packets arriving out of order (for example, if they used different paths) are re-ordered appropriately."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another protocol relying on IP is UDP (<emphasis>User Datagram Protocol</emphasis>). In contrast to TCP, it is packet-oriented. Its goals are different: the purpose of UDP is only to transmit one packet from an application to another. The protocol does not try to compensate for possible packet loss on the way, nor does it ensure that packets are received in the same order as were sent. The main advantage to this protocol is that the latency is greatly improved, since the loss of a single packet does not delay the receiving of all following packets until the lost one is retransmitted."
msgstr ""

msgid "TCP and UDP both involve ports, which are “extension numbers” for establishing communication with a given application on a machine. This concept allows keeping several different communications in parallel with the same correspondent, since these communications can be distinguished by the port number."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some of these port numbers — standardized by the IANA (<emphasis>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</emphasis>) — are “well-known” for being associated with network services.

msgid "When a local network uses a private address range (not routable on the Internet), the gateway needs to implement <emphasis>address masquerading</emphasis> so that the machines on the network can communicate with the outside world. The masquerading operation is a kind of proxy operating on the network level: each outgoing connection from an internal machine is replaced with a connection from the gateway itself (since the gateway does have an external, routable address), the data going through the masqueraded connection is sent to the new one, and the data coming back in reply is sent through to the masqueraded connection to the internal machine. The gateway uses a range of dedicated TCP ports for this purpose, usually with very high numbers (over 60000). Each connection coming from an internal machine then appears to the outside world as a connection coming from one of these reserved ports."

msgid "The gateway can also perform two kinds of <emphasis>network address translation</emphasis> (or NAT for short). The first kind, <emphasis>Destination NAT</emphasis> (DNAT) is a technique to alter the destination IP address (and/or the TCP or UDP port) for a (generally) incoming connection. The connection tracking mechanism also alters the following packets in the same connection to ensure continuity in the communication. The second kind of NAT is <emphasis>Source NAT</emphasis> (SNAT), of which <emphasis>masquerading</emphasis> is a particular case; SNAT alters the source IP address (and/or the TCP or UDP port) of a (generally) outgoing connection. As for DNAT, all the packets in the connection are appropriately handled by the connection tracking mechanism. Note that NAT is only relevant for IPv4 and its limited address space; in IPv6, the wide availability of addresses greatly reduces the usefulness of NAT by allowing all “internal” addresses to be directly routable on the Internet (this does not imply that internal machines are accessible, since intermediary firewalls can filter traffic)."

One solution involves the concept of a <emphasis>Certification Authority</emphasis> (CA), formalized by the X.509 standard. This term covers an entity that holds a trusted key pair known as a <emphasis>root certificate</emphasis>. This certificate is only used to sign other certificates (key pairs), after proper steps have been undertaken to check the identity stored on the key pair. Applications using X.509 can then check the certificates presented to them, if they know about the trusted root certificates."

Client certificates are installed on the corresponding VPN client in a similar fashion."
msgstr ""

msgid "By default, the OpenVPN initialization script tries starting all virtual private networks defined in <filename>/etc/openvpn/*.conf</filename>. Setting up a VPN server is therefore a matter of storing a corresponding configuration file in this directory. A good starting point is <filename>/usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz</filename>, which leads to a rather standard server. Of course, some parameters need to be adapted: <literal>ca</literal>, <literal>cert</literal>, <literal>key</literal> and <literal>dh</literal> need to describe the selected locations (respectively, <literal>/etc/ssl/certs/Falcot_CA.crt</literal>, <literal>/etc/ssl/vpn.falcot.com.crt</literal>, <literal>/etc/ssl/private/vpn.falcot.com.key</literal> and <literal>/etc/openvpn/dh.pem</literal>).

msgid "With this configuration, starting OpenVPN creates the virtual network interface, usually under the <literal>tun0</literal> name. However, firewalls are often configured at the same time as the real network interfaces, which happens before OpenVPN starts. Good practice therefore recommends creating a persistent virtual network interface, and configuring OpenVPN to use this pre-existing interface. This further allows choosing the name for this interface. To this end, <command>openvpn --mktun --dev vpn --dev-type tun</command> creates a virtual network interface named <literal>vpn</literal> with type <literal>tun</literal>; this command can easily be integrated in the firewall configuration script, or in an <literal>up</literal> directive of the <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> file, or a <emphasis role=\"package\">udev</emphasis> rule can be added to that end.

Furthermore, machines on the local network also need to be informed that the route to the VPN goes through the VPN server (this automatically works when the VPN server is installed on the gateway). Alternatively, the VPN server can be configured to perform IP masquerading so that connections coming from VPN clients appear as if they are coming from the VPN server instead (see <xref linkend=\"sect.gateway\" />)."
