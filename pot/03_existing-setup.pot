msgstr ""

msgid "As simple as it seems, this step is essential. A serious administrator truly knows the principal roles of each server, but such roles can change, and sometimes experienced users may have installed “wild” services. Knowing that they exist will at least allow you to decide what to do with them, rather than delete them haphazardly."
msgstr ""

msgid "For this purpose, it is wise to inform your users of the project before migrating the server. To involve them in the project, it may be useful to install the most common free software programs on their desktops prior to migration, which they will come across again after the migration to Debian; LibreOffice and the Mozilla suite are the best examples here."

But you should not forget that sources used in the past might have been deleted, and that some random packages grabbed on the Internet might have been manually installed (with the help of the <command>dpkg</command> command). In this case, the machine is misleading in its appearance of being a “standard” Debian system. This is why you should pay attention to any indication that will give away the presence of external packages (appearance of <filename>deb</filename> files in unusual directories, package version numbers with a special suffix indicating that it originated from outside the Debian project, such as <literal>ubuntu</literal> or <literal>lmde</literal>, etc.)."
