The latter is appropriate for a server receiving incoming email normally, but that sends outgoing email through an intermediate SMTP server — the “smarthost” — rather than directly to the recipient's server. This is mostly useful for individuals with a dynamic IP address, since many email servers reject messages coming straight from such an IP address. In this case, the smarthost will usually be the ISP's SMTP server, which is always configured to accept email coming from the ISP's customers and forward it appropriately.

msgstr ""

msgid "Theoretically, greylisting should only delay the first mail from a given sender to a given recipient, and the typical delay is in the order of minutes. Reality, however, can differ slightly. Some large ISPs use clusters of SMTP servers, and when a message is initially rejected, the server that retries the transmission may not be the same as the initial one. When that happens, the second server gets a temporary error message due to greylisting too, and so on; it may take several hours until transmission is attempted by a server that has already been involved, since SMTP servers usually increase the delay between retries at each failure."
msgstr ""

msgid "As a consequence, the incoming IP address may vary in time even for a single sender. But it goes further: even the sender address can change. For instance, many mailing-list servers encode extra information in the sender address so as to be able to handle error messages (known as <emphasis>bounces</emphasis>). Each new message sent to a mailing-list may then need to go through greylisting, which means it has to be stored (temporarily) on the sender's server. For very large mailing-lists (with tens of thousands of subscribers), this can soon become a problem."
msgstr ""

msgid "To mitigate these drawbacks, Postgrey manages a whitelist of such sites, and messages emanating from them are immediately accepted without going through greylisting.

msgid "Apache considers two different kinds of virtual hosts: those that are based on the IP address (or the port), and those that rely on the domain name of the web server. The first method requires allocating a different IP address (or port) for each site, whereas the second one can work on a single IP address (and port), and the sites are differentiated by the hostname sent by the HTTP client (which only works in version 1.1 of the HTTP protocol — fortunately that version is old enough that all clients use it already)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The (increasing) scarcity of IPv4 addresses usually favors the second method; however, it is made more complex if the virtual hosts need to provide HTTPS too, since the SSL protocol hasn't always provided for name-based virtual hosting; the SNI extension (<emphasis>Server Name Indication</emphasis>) that allows such a combination is not handled by all browsers. When several HTTPS sites need to run on the same server, they will usually be differentiated either by running on a different port or on a different IP address (IPv6 can help there)."

This allows Apache to select the most appropriate SSL certificate for the transaction to proceed."
